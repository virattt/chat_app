# LLM-Powered Chat Application
This repository contains all of the starter code needed to run an LLM-powered chat app on your local machine:
1. Django backend
2. React TypeScript frontend
3. LangChain Agents and LLMs

## Getting Started üöÄ
To run the chat app, you need to:

1. Clone this GitHub repo
2. Run the backend server
3. Run the frontend app

### 1. Clone this GitHub repo üìÅ
To clone this GitHub repo, open up your Terminal (MacOS) or Bash terminal (Windows) and navigate to wherever you want to save this repo on your local machine.  Then, run: 

```
git clone https://github.com/virattt/chat_app.git
```

Make sure that you have git installed ([instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)).

### 2. Run the backend server üñ•Ô∏è
Once you have this `chat_app` project cloned locally, navigate to the `backend` directory:

```
cd ~/path_to/chat_app/backend
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv myenv
```

For MacOS/Linux:
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the necessary libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the backend server:
```
daphne project.asgi:application
```

If your backend server is running correctly, you should see something like this:
```
"WSCONNECTING /ws/chat/" - -
"WSCONNECT /ws/chat/" - -
```

**Important**: In order to run the LLM, set your Open AI API key [here](https://github.com/virattt/chat_app/blob/main/backend/project/settings.py#L146).

### 3. Run the frontend app üíª
In a new Terminal window (or tab), navigate to the `frontend` directory:
```
cd ~/path_to/chat_app/frontend
```

Make sure that you have Node and npm installed (MacOS [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager#macos) and Windows [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager#windows-1))

Install the necessary packages:
```
npm install
```

Run the frontend app:
```
npm start
```

If successful, your browser should open and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.  The chat app should load automatically.

## Run with Docker
To run this project with docker, you must have docker installed. Then run the entire app:

```
docker-compose up
```
